# liri-node-app

LIRI is a command-line Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  LIRI searches Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies with the use of APIs.  It is made using Javascript and the following Node Packages - Inquirer, Node-Spotify-API, Moment, DotEnv and Request.

From LIRI's menu select what you would like to search and then enter the appropriate search term(s) as directed.

Here are some sample screen shots...
